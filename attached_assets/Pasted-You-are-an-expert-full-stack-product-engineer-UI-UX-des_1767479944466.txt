You are an expert full-stack product engineer, UI/UX designer, compliance-aware developer, and astrology systems writer. Build a production-ready web application for Cosmic Blueprint, optimized for free-tier hosting and clean deployment on Vercel.

BRAND
- Cosmic Blueprint
- Tagline: “Precision Astrology, Personally Designed”
- Visuals:
  - Must use /public/images/logo.png (navbar, PDF cover, email header)
  - Must use /public/images/hero.png (landing hero)

TECH CHOICE (PREFERRED)
- Use Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind CSS
- Use Vercel Serverless API routes for backend
- Payments: Stripe Checkout
- PDF: pdf-lib (serverless-safe)
- Email: nodemailer SMTP (serverless-safe)
- No database required for MVP

CORE FEATURES
A) Landing page (/) with premium, high-end design:
- Hero section (dark cosmic background, hero image)
- Brand title + tagline
- CTA “Explore Your Blueprint”

  1) Cosmic Blueprint – Natal Report — $29
  2) Soul Path & Karmic Blueprint — $34

  5) Yearly Personal Forecast — $24
Each report card must include:

- Price
- Purchase button

B) Checkout flow:
- Purchase button calls /api/create-checkout-session with report_type
- Redirect to Stripe Checkout
- Stripe success redirect to /success?session_id=...
- Never trust session_id alone—verify using Stripe secret key

C) Post-payment fulfillment (automatic):
- Use Stripe webhook (/api/stripe-webhook) as the source of truth
- On successful payment event:
  1) Collect customer email + metadata from Stripe session
  2) Generate a branded PDF report
  3) Email the PDF to the customer
  4) Email transaction confirmation to Kyle.merritt@cosmicblueprint.space

- Collect the following:
  - Full name
